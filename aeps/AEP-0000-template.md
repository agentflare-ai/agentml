## Summary
A one-paragraph summary of the proposal, written for readers new to AgentML.

---

## Motivation
Explain the problem or limitation this AEP addresses.
Why is it important?  
What use cases are currently blocked?

---

## Goals
- List the concrete, testable goals
- Optionally list explicit non-goals

---

## Design
Describe the proposed solution, structure, and rationale.  
Include:
- Key concepts and semantics
- Example AgentML snippets
- Message or signal flow
- Execution rules and transitions
- Validation or error behavior

---

## Schema Changes
Describe changes to the XSD/JSON schema, new attributes, or elements.  
Include migration and backward-compatibility notes if needed.

---

## Runtime Semantics
Explain how this affects interpreters, compilers, or agents.  
Cover determinism, timing, error handling, and testability.

---

## Security and Privacy
Threats, mitigations, and required safeguards.

---

## Performance
Expected impact and benchmarks. Include limits and edge cases.

---

## Interoperability
Versioning and compatibility with older AgentML documents or runtimes.

---

## Reference Implementation
Links to prototype code, runtime branches, or test suites.

---

## Rollout Plan
Steps for adoption:
1. Prototype
2. Schema validation
3. Runtime integration
4. Default enablement

---

## Unresolved Questions
Open items or decisions still pending review.

---

## Appendix
Optional diagrams, examples, pseudo-code, or test vectors.
